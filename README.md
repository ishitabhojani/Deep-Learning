# Deep-Learning

# LAB 1:
Lab 1 involved a practical task using the MNIST dataset from TensorFlow. The objective was to create and train models with varying complexities:

The first model included an input layer, a hidden layer, and a dense layer to predict images from 10 different classes.
The second model was an upgraded version, incorporating more hidden layers to improve performance.
The third model was trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with activation functions ReLU and Softmax.
Finally, the test and training accuracy of all three models were compared to evaluate their performance.
